            Title: Death Note - Episode 1: "Rebirth"

                Opening Caption: "In a world where justice is imperfect, one man will take it into his own hands. The power of the Death Note will change everything."

                Scene: The camera pans over a busy city street at night. People are rushing to get home, cars honk, and neon lights illuminate the area. We see a young man named Light Yagami, who is walking home from school. He's carrying a heavy backpack and looks tired.

                Caption: "Light Yagami - Age 17, High School Student."

                Light: (in his head) "Another day, another round of meaningless classes. I can't stand this anymore."

                Suddenly, a black notebook falls from the sky and lands at his feet. Light picks it up and examines it. The cover reads "Death Note."

                Caption: "The Death Note - A notebook that grants its user the power to kill anyone whose name is written in it."

                Light: (in his head) "What is this? Is it some kind of joke?"

                Just then, a figure appears out of the shadows. It's a strange-looking creature with a human-like face and wings.

                Caption: "Ryuk - The Shinigami who dropped the Death Note into the human world."

                Ryuk: (laughs) "Heh heh heh... That notebook belongs to you now. It's up to you to use it as you see fit."

                Light: (shocked) "Who... who are you?"

                Ryuk: "I am Ryuk, a Shinigami. I dropped that notebook into the human world out of boredom. It's been quite a while since anyone has used a Death Note, so I thought I'd spice things up a bit."

                Light: (in his head) "A Death Note... the power to kill anyone whose name I write in it... This could change everything."

                Ryuk: "You seem interested. Want to give it a try?"

                Light: (nervously) "I... I don't know."

                Ryuk: "Come on, what's the harm? You'll never know until you try."

                Light: (takes the notebook and pen) "Okay, I'll do it."

                Caption: "Light Yagami - The first human to possess a Death Note in over seven years."

                Light begins to test out the Death Note's power. He writes the name of a criminal he read about in the news, and the man dies of a heart attack within seconds. Light is shocked but also intrigued.

                Caption: "Light Yagami - The new god of the new world."

                Light: (in his head) "This is it. This is the way to rid the world of evil and create a better society."

                Ryuk: (smirking) "Looks like you've found your calling."

                Caption: "Death Note - The ultimate weapon of justice, or the tool of a madman?"

                The episode ends with Light walking off into the night, the Death Note in his hand, and a newfound sense of power and purpose.

                Closing Caption: "What will Light do with his newfound power? The game has only just begun."

        <summary>Episode 2</summary>
        <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">In the Royal Mint of Spain, tensions are high as Tokyo shot at police, allowing her affair with Rio to endanger The Professor's plans. Shortly after a discussion about women with Berlin, Rio is tasked with separating Alison Parker from the group. All hostages are given a red jumpsuit and a fake gun. The employees of the Royal Mint of Spain are also sent to print as many €50 notes as possible.

          Raquel Murillo and her colleague Ángel Rubio monitor the telephone network of the mint. However, Colonel Prieto of the Spanish intelligence has no intention of letting Raquel run everything. The police start a negotiation with the Professor, who advises police not to intervene. Raquel waits for the robbers to free the high school students. This is when we learn that one of the hostages, Alison Parker, is the daughter of the Ambassador of the United Kingdom, so it a priority to rescue her to prevent diplomatic issues. Colonel Prieto decides to enter the mint, as the Professor had predicted. However, after inserting an endoscope camera, the police realise that the robbers are masked and armed with a machine gun, forcing them to retreat. The robbers force Alison at gunpoint to announce to all of Spain that she, the daughter of the Ambassador of the United Kingdom, is being held hostage.

        <summary>Episode 3</summary>

        
        <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Inspector Murillo, tired of the conflicts with Colonel Prieto, calls her boss at six in the morning from the Bar Hanoi to resign. Unfortunately for her, her phone has no more battery, but a stranger, who is none other than the Professor, offers her his phone. Later, her boss calls her back and convinces her to return to work.

          In the Royal Mint of Spain, the robbers have already managed to print €52 million and continue with their plan. A hostage, Mónica Gaztambide, is responsible for reading the police a press release from the robbers, which specifies that the hostages are being treated well, and above all, that they cannot enter the mint without risking injuring hostages. Ángel Rubio orders police not to shoot, contrary to what Colonel Prieto had hoped.
          
          
          Berlin recruits a few hostages (including Arturo Román and Pablo Ruiz) to dig a tunnel in the basement of the building. Soon after, Alison Parker who wants to delete a private photo of herself on the Internet, manages to get her phone while Tokyo and Rio are busy arguing. This allows the police to hack into the camera of Alison's smartphone, and capture a photo of Rio's face. Berlin decides to punish Rio for his carelessness and orders Oslo and Helsinki to beat him, angering Tokyo.
