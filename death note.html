            Title: Death Note - Episode 1: "Rebirth"

                Opening Caption: "In a world where justice is imperfect, one man will take it into his own hands. The power of the Death Note will change everything."

                Scene: The camera pans over a busy city street at night. People are rushing to get home, cars honk, and neon lights illuminate the area. We see a young man named Light Yagami, who is walking home from school. He's carrying a heavy backpack and looks tired.

                Caption: "Light Yagami - Age 17, High School Student."

                Light: (in his head) "Another day, another round of meaningless classes. I can't stand this anymore."

                Suddenly, a black notebook falls from the sky and lands at his feet. Light picks it up and examines it. The cover reads "Death Note."

                Caption: "The Death Note - A notebook that grants its user the power to kill anyone whose name is written in it."

                Light: (in his head) "What is this? Is it some kind of joke?"

                Just then, a figure appears out of the shadows. It's a strange-looking creature with a human-like face and wings.

                Caption: "Ryuk - The Shinigami who dropped the Death Note into the human world."

                Ryuk: (laughs) "Heh heh heh... That notebook belongs to you now. It's up to you to use it as you see fit."

                Light: (shocked) "Who... who are you?"

                Ryuk: "I am Ryuk, a Shinigami. I dropped that notebook into the human world out of boredom. It's been quite a while since anyone has used a Death Note, so I thought I'd spice things up a bit."

                Light: (in his head) "A Death Note... the power to kill anyone whose name I write in it... This could change everything."

                Ryuk: "You seem interested. Want to give it a try?"

                Light: (nervously) "I... I don't know."

                Ryuk: "Come on, what's the harm? You'll never know until you try."

                Light: (takes the notebook and pen) "Okay, I'll do it."

                Caption: "Light Yagami - The first human to possess a Death Note in over seven years."

                Light begins to test out the Death Note's power. He writes the name of a criminal he read about in the news, and the man dies of a heart attack within seconds. Light is shocked but also intrigued.

                Caption: "Light Yagami - The new god of the new world."

                Light: (in his head) "This is it. This is the way to rid the world of evil and create a better society."

                Ryuk: (smirking) "Looks like you've found your calling."

                Caption: "Death Note - The ultimate weapon of justice, or the tool of a madman?"

                The episode ends with Light walking off into the night, the Death Note in his hand, and a newfound sense of power and purpose.

                Closing Caption: "What will Light do with his newfound power? The game has only just begun."
