          Title: The Perfect Heist

          Opening shot of a bank. Inside, we see a group of people in red jumpsuits wearing Salvador Dali masks. They are armed with automatic weapons and are holding the bankâ€™s employees and customers hostage.
          
          Caption: "One year ago, a group of eight criminals planned the perfect heist."
          
          The leader of the group, who goes by the name of "The Professor," is in a van parked outside the bank. He is monitoring the situation and communicating with the rest of the group through a radio.
          
          Professor: (over the radio) "Everyone, stay calm and focused. Remember, we're here for the money, not the people."
          
          Tokyo: (over the radio) "Got it, Professor. We won't let you down."
          
          Caption: "The group is led by a mysterious man known as 'The Professor.'"
          
          Meanwhile, inside the bank, tensions are high. One of the hostages, a young woman named Monica, is trying to remain calm.
          
          Monica: (to Denver) "Please don't hurt us. We have families, just like you."
          
          Denver: "Don't worry, we're not here to hurt anyone. We just want the money."
          
          Caption: "But not everything goes according to plan."
          
          Suddenly, the police arrive outside the bank. The group is taken aback, but The Professor quickly comes up with a plan.
          
          Professor: (over the radio) "Tokyo, get everyone to the basement. Helsinki, start drilling the vault. We need to move fast."
          
          Caption: "The group must improvise to overcome the unexpected obstacles."
          
          As the police try to negotiate with the robbers, The Professor starts executing his plan.
          
          Professor: (over the radio) "Moscow, use the hostages as a shield. Rio, cover him with your weapon. We need to keep the police at bay."
          
          Caption: "But will they be able to pull off the perfect heist?"
          
          After several tense moments, the group manages to escape from the bank with the money. They make their way to a safe house where they divide the loot.
          
          Caption: "Find out in the next episode of Money Heist."
          
          The episode ends with a shot of The Professor looking out the window, as the police sirens fade into the distance.
