        (Scene 1)

        The movie starts with Pathaan (played by Shah Rukh Khan) standing on a rooftop, looking out over the city. A gentle breeze is blowing and his hair is rustling.
        
        Pathaan: (voiceover) “I have always lived on the edge, never quite fitting in. But now, I have a chance to make a difference.”
        
        Caption: “Shah Rukh Khan is Pathaan.”
        
        (Scene 2)
        
        The camera then cuts to Pathaan entering a high-security building. He is wearing a black leather jacket, with his collar turned up, and carrying a black duffel bag. He moves quickly and quietly, dodging the guards and using his martial arts skills to take them out one by one.
        
        Caption: “The city is his playground.”
        
        (Scene 3)
        
        Pathaan reaches the target room, where he finds a group of terrorists planning a major attack. They are huddled around a table, looking at maps and blueprints. The terrorist leader, a burly man with a thick beard, looks up and sees Pathaan.
        
        Terrorist Leader: (smirking) “Well, well. Look who’s here.”
        
        Pathaan: (calmly) “I’m here to stop you.”
        
        Terrorist Leader: (laughing) “You think you can stop us? We’re willing to die for our cause.”
        
        (Pathaan engages in a tense standoff with the terrorists, using his wits and fighting skills to try and prevent the attack.)
        
        Caption: “When the stakes are high, he’s the only one who can save the day.”
        
        (Scene 4)
        
        The camera then cuts to Pathaan in a flashback, revealing his troubled past and how he became the hero he is today. He is shown as a young boy, getting into fights and struggling to fit in. His father is an ex-army officer, who teaches him martial arts and discipline.
        
        Pathaan: (voiceover) “I never wanted this life. But sometimes, fate has other plans for you.”
        
        Caption: “His past has shaped him.”
        
        (Scene 5)
        
        The camera cuts back to the present, with Pathaan fighting against a powerful opponent. They are both wearing traditional Pathani suits and the fight takes place in an abandoned warehouse. Pathaan is using all of his skills to stay alive, dodging punches and kicks, and using his own moves to fight back.
        
        Caption: “His fight for justice never ends.”
        
        (Scene 6)
        
        The camera then cuts to the climactic final battle, with Pathaan facing off against the mastermind behind the terrorist plot. The mastermind is a shadowy figure, whose face is never fully revealed. They are in a large underground chamber, with dim lighting and flickering torches.
        
        Mastermind: (smirking) “You can’t stop us, Pathaan. We’re too powerful.”
        
        Pathaan: (smiling) “You haven’t seen anything yet.”
        
        (Pathaan engages in a fierce battle with the mastermind, using his training and intellect to overcome the odds and save the day.)
        
        Caption: “The ultimate battle for justice.”
        
        (Scene 7)
        
        The movie ends with Pathaan walking out of the underground chamber, victorious. He takes a deep breath of fresh air and looks up at the sky. The camera pans up, showing the city in the distance.
        
        Caption: “Shah Rukh Khan is Pathaan. Coming soon to theaters near you.”
        
        (Scene fades to black, with the Pathaan logo appearing on screen.)
