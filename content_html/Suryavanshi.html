"Suryavanshi" is a 2021 Indian Hindi-language action film directed by Rohit Shetty and produced by Reliance Entertainment, Dharma Productions, and Cape of Good Films. The movie stars Akshay Kumar, Katrina Kaif, Ajay Devgn, and Ranveer Singh in lead roles.

The story revolves around Veer Suryavanshi (Akshay Kumar), an Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) officer who is tasked with stopping a terrorist attack in Mumbai. The terrorist, known only as "The Ghost," is a wanted criminal who has been on the run for years. Veer receives help from his superiors, DCP Bajirao Singham (Ajay Devgn) and Inspector Sangram "Simmba" Bhalerao (Ranveer Singh), who are also members of the police force.

As the story progresses, Veer's investigation leads him to a mysterious figure named "Khalid," who is revealed to be the mastermind behind the terrorist attacks. Khalid is a former RAW agent who was betrayed by his own agency and left for dead. He seeks revenge by unleashing a series of devastating attacks on Mumbai.

With the help of his team and the support of Singham and Simmba, Veer races against time to stop Khalid and prevent him from carrying out his final attack. The film is filled with intense action sequences, high-speed car chases, and explosive confrontations, culminating in a thrilling climax that sees the heroes face off against the villain in a dramatic showdown.

Overall, "Suryavanshi" is a fast-paced, action-packed movie that delivers on its promise of non-stop entertainment. It showcases the strength and courage of the Indian police force and reinforces the message that terrorism will not be tolerated in any form. The movie features powerful performances from the cast, stunning visuals, and an engaging storyline that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats from start to finish.    dsvvsn
