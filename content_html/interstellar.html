"Interstellar" is a science fiction movie directed by Christopher Nolan and released in 2014. The movie stars Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, and Jessica Chastain.

The story follows a group of astronauts who travel through a wormhole in search of a new habitable planet for humanity, as Earth is dying due to a crop blight and climate change. Here are some of the major scenes:

The movie starts with a scene showing Cooper (McConaughey), a former NASA pilot and engineer, on his farm with his children. He receives a message through gravity manipulation that leads him to a secret NASA facility.

At the NASA facility, Cooper learns about the wormhole and the mission to find a new habitable planet. He is asked to join the mission, which involves traveling through the wormhole with a crew of scientists and a robot named TARS.

The crew travels through the wormhole to explore three potential habitable planets orbiting a black hole. They encounter several challenges, including the loss of one crew member and the discovery that one planet is covered in water and another has a dangerous atmosphere.

The crew decides to visit the third planet, which appears to be the most promising. They discover that the planet's time is severely distorted due to the gravitational influence of the nearby black hole. This leads to some intense scenes, including a massive tidal wave that threatens to engulf the crew.

On the third planet, the crew discovers that a previous mission, led by Dr. Mann (played by Matt Damon), has failed and that Mann has lied about the habitability of the planet. Mann attempts to kill Cooper and steal the spaceship to escape the planet, leading to a dramatic fight scene.

Cooper decides to sacrifice himself by entering the black hole to send crucial data back to Earth that will help humanity survive. He ends up in a mysterious tesseract, a construct of time and space, that allows him to communicate with his daughter and give her the data she needs to save humanity.

The movie ends with Cooper being rescued and reunited with his daughter, who is now an old woman. The data he sent through the tesseract has enabled humanity to build space colonies and save themselves from extinction
