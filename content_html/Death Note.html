            Title: Death Note - Episode 1: "Rebirth"

                Opening Caption: "In a world where justice is imperfect, one man will take it into his own hands. The power of the Death Note will change everything."

                Scene: The camera pans over a busy city street at night. People are rushing to get home, cars honk, and neon lights illuminate the area. We see a young man named Light Yagami, who is walking home from school. He's carrying a heavy backpack and looks tired.

                Caption: "Light Yagami - Age 17, High School Student."

                Light: (in his head) "Another day, another round of meaningless classes. I can't stand this anymore."

                Suddenly, a black notebook falls from the sky and lands at his feet. Light picks it up and examines it. The cover reads "Death Note."

                Caption: "The Death Note - A notebook that grants its user the power to kill anyone whose name is written in it."

                Light: (in his head) "What is this? Is it some kind of joke?"

                Just then, a figure appears out of the shadows. It's a strange-looking creature with a human-like face and wings.

                Caption: "Ryuk - The Shinigami who dropped the Death Note into the human world."

                Ryuk: (laughs) "Heh heh heh... That notebook belongs to you now. It's up to you to use it as you see fit."

                Light: (shocked) "Who... who are you?"

                Ryuk: "I am Ryuk, a Shinigami. I dropped that notebook into the human world out of boredom. It's been quite a while since anyone has used a Death Note, so I thought I'd spice things up a bit."

                Light: (in his head) "A Death Note... the power to kill anyone whose name I write in it... This could change everything."

                Ryuk: "You seem interested. Want to give it a try?"

                Light: (nervously) "I... I don't know."

                Ryuk: "Come on, what's the harm? You'll never know until you try."

                Light: (takes the notebook and pen) "Okay, I'll do it."

                Caption: "Light Yagami - The first human to possess a Death Note in over seven years."

                Light begins to test out the Death Note's power. He writes the name of a criminal he read about in the news, and the man dies of a heart attack within seconds. Light is shocked but also intrigued.

                Caption: "Light Yagami - The new god of the new world."

                Light: (in his head) "This is it. This is the way to rid the world of evil and create a better society."

                Ryuk: (smirking) "Looks like you've found your calling."

                Caption: "Death Note - The ultimate weapon of justice, or the tool of a madman?"

                The episode ends with Light walking off into the night, the Death Note in his hand, and a newfound sense of power and purpose.

                Closing Caption: "What will Light do with his newfound power? The game has only just begun."

                    Opening Caption: "With great power comes great consequences. Light's actions have not gone unnoticed, and a game of cat and mouse begins."

                    Scene: The episode starts with Light sitting at his desk, thinking about how he can use the Death Note to create a better world. Suddenly, his phone rings, and he answers it.

                    Voice on the phone: "Hello, Light Yagami. I am L."

                    Light: (surprised) "Who are you? How did you get my number?"

                    L: "That's not important. What is important is that I know what you've been doing."

                    Light: (in his head) "What is he talking about? How does he know?"

                    L: "You've been killing people, haven't you? Using a Death Note."

                    Light: (sternly) "I don't know what you're talking about."

                    L: "Oh, I think you do. I have been investigating this case for some time now, and I believe that you are the one responsible."

                    Caption: "L - The world-renowned detective, known only by his alias."

                    Light: (in his head) "This is bad. I didn't think anyone would find out about this."

                    L: "I'm giving you a chance to come clean. If you turn yourself in, I promise to make sure you receive a fair trial."

                    Light: (calmly) "I have nothing to confess. I don't know what you're talking about."

                    L: "Very well. I'll be keeping a close eye on you, Light Yagami. Don't make any mistakes."

                    Caption: "The game of cat and mouse begins. Light must outsmart L while continuing to carry out his plan."

                    Scene: Light's sister, Sayu, comes into his room and asks him if he wants to play a game with her. Light agrees, hoping to distract himself from the situation with L. As they play, Light begins to think about how he can use the Death Note to manipulate people into doing what he wants.

                    Caption: "Light's plan to use the Death Note to control people and create a better world."

                    Sayu: "What are you thinking about?"

                    Light: (smiling) "Just a new strategy for the game."

                    Sayu: (laughing) "You always come up with the best strategies."

                    Caption: "Sayu Yagami - Light's younger sister."

                    Scene: Later that night, Light is alone in his room, writing in the Death Note. He thinks about L and how he can outsmart him.

                    Caption: "Light's plan to get rid of L."

                    Light: (in his head) "I can't let him catch me. I need to find a way to get rid of him."

                    Just then, Ryuk appears.

                    Ryuk: "What's on your mind?"

                    Light: "I need your help. I want to know everything there is to know about L."

                    Ryuk: "I can help you with that, but it won't be easy. L is a world-renowned detective, and he's extremely secretive."

                    Caption: "Ryuk - Light's only ally in the world of the Death Note."

                    Light: "I don't care. I need to know everything there is to know about him. If I can't outsmart him, I'm as good as dead."

                    Ryuk: "Very well. I'll help you, but you need to be careful. L is not someone to be underestimated."

                    Closing Caption: "Light's plan to get rid of L begins. Will he succeed, or will

Title: Death Note - Episode 3: "Dealings"

Opening Caption: "As Light's plan to outsmart L unfolds, a new player enters the game."

Scene: Light is at school, thinking about his plan to get rid of L. He's interrupted by the arrival of a new student, Misa Amane.

Caption: "Misa Amane - The second Kira."

Light: (in his head) "Who is she? And why is she staring at me?"

Misa: (approaching Light) "Hi there. My name is Misa Amane. I'm new here."

Light: (polite) "Hi, I'm Light Yagami. Nice to meet you."

Misa: (flirtatious) "You're really handsome, Light. Have you ever thought about being a model?"

Caption: "Misa's infatuation with Light."

Light: (awkwardly) "Uh, no. I've never thought about that."

Misa: (giggles) "Well, you should. You'd be great at it."

Scene: Later that day, Light and Misa are talking in the school courtyard.

Caption: "Light and Misa's conversation."

Misa: "So, what do you like to do in your free time, Light?"

Light: "I mostly study. I want to become a lawyer one day."

Misa: "A lawyer? That's so cool. I'm an aspiring actress myself."

Light: "Really? That's great."

Misa: "Yeah, I've been in a few commercials and music videos. But my real dream is to become a famous actress."

Caption: "Misa's hidden motive."

Light: "I'm sure you'll achieve your dream, Misa."

Misa: (suddenly serious) "Light, can I ask you something?"

Light: "Sure, what is it?"

Misa: "Do you believe in justice?"

Light: (curious) "What do you mean?"

Misa: "I mean, do you think that bad people should be punished for their crimes?"

Caption: "Misa's interest in justice."

Light: "Of course. That's why I want to become a lawyer. To make sure that justice is served."

Misa: "I feel the same way. That's why I admire Kira so much."

Caption: "Misa's admiration for Kira."

Light: (surprised) "Kira? What do you mean?"

Misa: "You haven't heard of Kira? He's the one who's been killing criminals. I think what he's doing is amazing. He's punishing the bad people and making the world a better place."

Caption: "Misa's revelation about Kira."

Light: (in his head) "She knows about Kira? Could she be the second Kira?"

Scene: Later that night, Light is in his room, writing in the Death Note. He's interrupted by the sound of Ryuk's laughter.

Caption: "Ryuk's reaction to Light's plan."

Ryuk: (laughing) "This is getting interesting, Light. You have two girls after you now."

Light: (annoyed) "It's not funny, Ryuk. I need to figure out if Misa is the second Kira."

Ryuk: "Well, if she is, it could be to your advantage. You could use her to your advantage."

Caption: "Ryuk's advice to Light."

Light: "What do you mean?"

Ryuk: "If Misa is the second Kira, you could work together to achieve your goals. With two Death Notes, you could become even more powerful than Kira."

Light: (thinking) "Ryuk's right. Working with Misa could be the key to taking down L and becoming the god of the new world."

Scene: Light contacts Misa and meets up with her at a café.

Caption: "Light and Misa's deal."

Misa: "So, what did you want to talk to me about, Light?"

Light: "I know about Kira, Misa. And I think you're the second Kira."

Misa: (surprised) "What? How did you know?"

Light: "I have my ways. But I don't want to turn you in. In fact, I want to work with you."

Misa: "Work with me? What do you mean?"

Light: "I mean, we can use our Death Notes to eliminate our enemies and create a better world. Together, we can become more powerful than Kira ever was."

Misa: (excited) "That sounds amazing, Light! I'm in."

Caption: "Light's plan to team up with Misa."

Scene: Light and Misa begin working together to eliminate criminals. Meanwhile, L continues to investigate Kira and the second Kira.

Caption: "L's investigation."

L: (talking to his team) "It seems that Kira has a new ally. We need to find out who the second Kira is and stop them before it's too late."

Caption: "The game continues."

Closing Caption: "As Light and Misa's alliance grows stronger, L's investigation heats up. Who will come out on top?"

                Opening Caption: Light Yagami continues his desperate attempt to regain his Death Note, while L and his team pursue the evidence connecting Light to the murders.
                
                Scene: Inside a warehouse, Light is seen desperately searching for his Death Note. He's sweating and panting heavily, as he throws boxes and crates aside, looking for any sign of the notebook.
                
                Light: (frustrated) "Where is it? I know I left it here somewhere!"
                
                Scene: Meanwhile, L and the Task Force are discussing the case at headquarters.
                
                L: (serious tone) "Gentlemen, we must continue our investigation of Light Yagami. We have strong evidence linking him to the murders, and we cannot allow him to continue his killing spree."
                
                Aizawa: (nodding) "Yes, sir. But what about the Death Note? We know that Light had it, but we don't know where it is now."
                
                L: (thoughtful) "I have a feeling that Light is still searching for it. He knows that without the Death Note, he has no power."
                
                Scene: Back in the warehouse, Light's search comes to an end as he finally finds the notebook hidden under a pile of boxes. He picks it up with a sense of relief.
                
                Light: (smirking) "Finally, it's mine again."
                
                Scene: Just as Light is about to leave, he hears footsteps outside the warehouse. He quickly hides behind a crate and sees that it's the Task Force. They enter the warehouse and start searching.
                
                L: (instructing the Task Force) "Split up and search the area thoroughly. We need to find any evidence that connects Light to the murders."
                
                Scene: Light watches from his hiding spot as the Task Force searches the warehouse. He starts to panic, realizing that if they find him or the Death Note, he will be caught.
                
                Light: (whispering to himself) "I need to get out of here. But how?"
                
                Scene: Suddenly, Light sees a piece of metal piping lying nearby. He quickly picks it up and hides it behind his back.
                
                Light: (thinking) "If they find me, I'll have to defend myself."
                
                Scene: As Light sneaks through the warehouse, he sees one of the Task Force members approaching him. He raises the pipe and prepares to strike.
                
                Scene: Meanwhile, L and the rest of the Task Force are still searching for any evidence. Suddenly, they hear a loud crash and a scream.
                
                Aizawa: (alarmed) "What was that?"
                
                L: (urgently) "Quickly, let's go see!"
                
                Scene: They rush to the source of the noise and find Light standing over the fallen Task Force member, holding the metal pipe.
                
                L: (shocked and disappointed) "Light, what have you done?"
                
                Light: (defensively) "I had no choice. He was going to arrest me."
                
                L: (firmly) "That's not true. You could have surrendered peacefully."
                
                Light: (smiling menacingly) "But where's the fun in that?"
                
                Scene: The episode ends with Light being taken into custody, while his eyes glint with malice and a plan forms in his mind.
                
                Closing Caption: As Light is taken into custody, he continues to plot and scheme, determined to reclaim his power and outwit L once and for all. But will he succeed, or will justice finally be served?

                Sure, here's the summary of Death Note Episode 36:

                Title: 1.28
                
                Caption: Light is on the verge of achieving his goal, but Near stands in his way.
                
                Scene 1:
                The episode begins with Light and Misa discussing their plan to kill Near and his team. They are both confident that they can succeed, as they have done in the past. Light believes that he has the upper hand, as he has already found a way to bypass the SPK's investigation.
                
                Light: "We can't let Near and his team get in the way. We have to eliminate them, and fast."
                
                Misa: "I'm with you all the way, Light. We'll make sure they never see it coming."
                
                Scene 2:
                Meanwhile, Near and his team are discussing their next move. They have come up with a plan to capture Kira, but they know that it won't be easy. Near is confident that he can outsmart Light and Misa, but he is also aware that they are both dangerous opponents.
                
                Near: "We have to be careful. Kira is no ordinary criminal. He's a genius, just like us."
                
                Mello: "We can't let our guard down for a second. If we do, Kira will slip away again."
                
                Scene 3:
                As Light and Misa prepare to execute their plan, they receive an unexpected visitor - Mikami. He informs them that he has found a way to contact Kira without being detected by the SPK. Light is thrilled with this news and orders Mikami to proceed with his plan.
                
                Light: "This is it. We can finally finish what we started. Mikami, you know what to do."
                
                Mikami: "Yes, Kira. I won't fail you."
                
                Scene 4:
                Near and his team are also getting ready for their final showdown with Kira. They have set up a trap, hoping to catch Kira off guard. However, as they wait for Kira to make his move, they receive a shocking revelation - Mikami has been acting on Kira's behalf.
                
                Near: "This changes everything. Mikami is Kira's right-hand man. We have to move fast."
                
                Mello: "I'll go after Mikami. You take care of Kira."
                
                Scene 5:
                The episode ends with Light realizing that his plan has failed. Mikami has been captured by Near, and his Death Note has been confiscated. Light is devastated, as he realizes that his dream of becoming the new god of the world has come to an end.
                
                Light: "This can't be happening. I was so close. How could I have been so careless?"
                
                Misa: "Don't worry, Light. We'll find a way to get out of this. We always do."
                
                Caption: The game is over. Light has lost, and Near has won.

                Title: "New World"

                Opening Caption: "With the Death Note in his hands, Light attempts to create a perfect world. But will he succeed?"
                
                Scene 1: Light's Plan
                
                (We see Light sitting in his chair in the warehouse, surrounded by various computer screens and pieces of equipment. He's typing away at his computer, looking very focused. Ryuk is perched on top of a shelf, watching him.)
                
                Light: (to himself) "With Near closing in, I need to act fast. But I have a plan. A plan that will ensure my victory and the creation of a new world."
                
                Ryuk: "What plan is that?"
                
                Light: "I'm going to write my own name in the Death Note. But before I die, I'm going to transfer ownership to someone else. That way, even if I die, my plan can still be carried out."
                
                Ryuk: "And who do you plan on giving the Death Note to?"
                
                Light: "Someone who shares my ideals. Someone who understands what needs to be done. And that someone is…"
                
                Scene 2: Matsuda's Confession
                
                (We see Matsuda walking down a deserted street, looking very agitated. He seems to be talking to himself.)
                
                Matsuda: "I can't take it anymore. I need to confess. I need to tell everyone what I did."
                
                (As he's talking, he bumps into someone on the street.)
                
                Matsuda: "Oh, I'm sorry. I wasn't paying attention."
                
                (He looks up and sees that the person he bumped into is a man wearing a hooded sweatshirt.)
                
                Matsuda: "Hey, watch where you're going."
                
                (The man says nothing and starts to walk away. Matsuda grabs his arm.)
                
                Matsuda: "Hey, I'm talking to you. Who are you?"
                
                (The man suddenly turns around and punches Matsuda in the face, knocking him to the ground. He then pulls out a gun and points it at Matsuda's head.)
                
                Hooded Man: "You're Matsuda, right? One of the people who helped catch Kira?"
                
                Matsuda: "Y-yes. Please, don't kill me."
                
                Hooded Man: "I'm not going to kill you. I just want you to deliver a message to your friends at the task force."
                
                (He hands Matsuda a piece of paper with a message written on it.)
                
                Hooded Man: "Tell them to read this carefully. And tell them that Kira's new world is about to begin."
                
                Scene 3: Near's Plan
                
                (We see Near and the other members of the SPK gathered around a table, discussing their next move.)
                
                Near: "We need to move quickly. Kira is planning something big. But we don't know what it is yet."
                
                SPK Member 1: "We could try to track him down using his phone or computer records."
                
                SPK Member 2: "But he's probably already taken steps to cover his tracks."
                
                Near: "We need to find a way to get inside his head. To understand how he thinks and what he's planning."
                
                (Just then, Matsuda bursts into the room, looking frantic.)
                
                Matsuda: "Near, you have to read this message. It's from someone who claims to be working with Kira."
                
                (Near takes the message and reads it.)
                
                Near: "This is interesting. Kira is planning to transfer ownership of the Death Note to someone else before he dies. That way, his plan can still be carried out."
