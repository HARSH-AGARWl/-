   (Scene 1)

Adonis: (breathing heavily, in the boxing ring) Come on, is that all you got?

Opponent: (panting, struggling to keep up) You're not gonna last much longer, Creed.

Announcer: (over loudspeaker) And it looks like we're heading into the final round of this championship match. Can Adonis Creed hold on to his title?

Caption: “The champ falls.”

(Scene 2)

Adonis: (sitting alone in his dressing room, head in his hands) I can't believe I lost.

Apollo: (appears in a flashback/dream) Hey, son.

Adonis: (looks up, shocked) Dad? Is it really you?

Apollo: (smiling) You've got my blood in you, Adonis. You can't let one loss bring you down.

Adonis: (tearfully) I don't know if I can do this.

Apollo: (encouragingly) You can. You've got what it takes to be a champion. Just like me.

Caption: “A father’s legacy lives on.”

(Scene 3)

Adonis: (training in the gym with Rocky) I need to get my title back.

Rocky: (nodding) You can do it. You just gotta keep fighting.

Bianca: (entering the gym) Hey, baby.

Adonis: (embracing her) I'm doing this for us. For our family.

Amara: (running up and hugging Adonis’ leg) Daddy!

Adonis: (smiling down at her) And for our future.

Caption: “Fighting for more than just himself.”

(Scene 4)

Malik: (introducing himself to Adonis) You're gonna be fighting me next.

Adonis: (confidently) I'll take you down, no problem.

Rocky: (to Adonis) Watch out for this kid. He's hungry.

Bianca: (to Adonis) And he's not afraid to play dirty.

Adonis: (determinedly) I won't let him beat me.

Caption: “New blood, new challenges.”

(Scene 5)

Announcer: (over loudspeaker) And we're live, folks! The much-anticipated match between Adonis Creed and Malik is about to begin.

Crowd: (cheering)

Adonis: (in the ring, staring down Malik) You're going down.

Malik: (smirking) We'll see about that.

The match begins, with both fighters trading punches and delivering punishing blows. The crowd is on the edge of their seats as the match becomes more intense.

Adonis: (grunting with each punch) Come on, is that all you got?

Malik: (also grunting) You're not as tough as you think.

Adonis and Malik continue to battle, with each fighter pushing themselves to their limit.

Caption: “The fight of their lives.”

(Scene 6)

Adonis: (standing victorious in the ring, arms raised in triumph) I did it.

Bianca: (running up to him and embracing him) I knew you could do it.

Rocky: (proudly) You're a true champion.

Adonis: (looking up at the statue of Apollo Creed) This is for you, Dad.

Caption: “The champ rises again.”
