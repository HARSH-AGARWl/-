          Title: The Perfect Heist

          Opening shot of a bank. Inside, we see a group of people in red jumpsuits wearing Salvador Dali masks. They are armed with automatic weapons and are holding the bankâ€™s employees and customers hostage.
          
          Caption: "One year ago, a group of eight criminals planned the perfect heist."
          
          The leader of the group, who goes by the name of "The Professor," is in a van parked outside the bank. He is monitoring the situation and communicating with the rest of the group through a radio.
          
          Professor: (over the radio) "Everyone, stay calm and focused. Remember, we're here for the money, not the people."
          
          Tokyo: (over the radio) "Got it, Professor. We won't let you down."
          
          Caption: "The group is led by a mysterious man known as 'The Professor.'"
          
          Meanwhile, inside the bank, tensions are high. One of the hostages, a young woman named Monica, is trying to remain calm.
          
          Monica: (to Denver) "Please don't hurt us. We have families, just like you."
          
          Denver: "Don't worry, we're not here to hurt anyone. We just want the money."
          
          Caption: "But not everything goes according to plan."
          
          Suddenly, the police arrive outside the bank. The group is taken aback, but The Professor quickly comes up with a plan.
          
          Professor: (over the radio) "Tokyo, get everyone to the basement. Helsinki, start drilling the vault. We need to move fast."
          
          Caption: "The group must improvise to overcome the unexpected obstacles."
          
          As the police try to negotiate with the robbers, The Professor starts executing his plan.
          
          Professor: (over the radio) "Moscow, use the hostages as a shield. Rio, cover him with your weapon. We need to keep the police at bay."
          
          Caption: "But will they be able to pull off the perfect heist?"
          
          After several tense moments, the group manages to escape from the bank with the money. They make their way to a safe house where they divide the loot.
          
          Caption: "Find out in the next episode of Money Heist."
          
          The episode ends with a shot of The Professor looking out the window, as the police sirens fade into the distance.

            Title: Death Note - Episode 1: "Rebirth"

                Opening Caption: "In a world where justice is imperfect, one man will take it into his own hands. The power of the Death Note will change everything."

                Scene: The camera pans over a busy city street at night. People are rushing to get home, cars honk, and neon lights illuminate the area. We see a young man named Light Yagami, who is walking home from school. He's carrying a heavy backpack and looks tired.

                Caption: "Light Yagami - Age 17, High School Student."

                Light: (in his head) "Another day, another round of meaningless classes. I can't stand this anymore."

                Suddenly, a black notebook falls from the sky and lands at his feet. Light picks it up and examines it. The cover reads "Death Note."

                Caption: "The Death Note - A notebook that grants its user the power to kill anyone whose name is written in it."

                Light: (in his head) "What is this? Is it some kind of joke?"

                Just then, a figure appears out of the shadows. It's a strange-looking creature with a human-like face and wings.

                Caption: "Ryuk - The Shinigami who dropped the Death Note into the human world."

                Ryuk: (laughs) "Heh heh heh... That notebook belongs to you now. It's up to you to use it as you see fit."

                Light: (shocked) "Who... who are you?"

                Ryuk: "I am Ryuk, a Shinigami. I dropped that notebook into the human world out of boredom. It's been quite a while since anyone has used a Death Note, so I thought I'd spice things up a bit."

                Light: (in his head) "A Death Note... the power to kill anyone whose name I write in it... This could change everything."

                Ryuk: "You seem interested. Want to give it a try?"

                Light: (nervously) "I... I don't know."

                Ryuk: "Come on, what's the harm? You'll never know until you try."

                Light: (takes the notebook and pen) "Okay, I'll do it."

                Caption: "Light Yagami - The first human to possess a Death Note in over seven years."

                Light begins to test out the Death Note's power. He writes the name of a criminal he read about in the news, and the man dies of a heart attack within seconds. Light is shocked but also intrigued.

                Caption: "Light Yagami - The new god of the new world."

                Light: (in his head) "This is it. This is the way to rid the world of evil and create a better society."

                Ryuk: (smirking) "Looks like you've found your calling."

                Caption: "Death Note - The ultimate weapon of justice, or the tool of a madman?"

                The episode ends with Light walking off into the night, the Death Note in his hand, and a newfound sense of power and purpose.

                Closing Caption: "What will Light do with his newfound power? The game has only just begun."
